  <h1>Traditional/2D Animation</h1>
  <p>The animation industry has grown to become an absolute behemoth in the world of cinema. As of the last reliable estimates, which surfaced around 2008, the industry 
	  was reported to be worth a cool $68.4 billion alone. 2D Animation is the process of making hundreds of drawings and then having them animate by playing them in rapid
	  succession. This is the most common form of animation, and has been used for several decades across several forms of media.Traditional 2D animation involves making 
	  a drawing and then making a second drawing of the same thing, but with a very subtle change (such as a closed mouth to an open mouth or a person taking one 
	  footstep). Hundreds, if not thousands, of unique drawings are made that go from the beginning of a scene to the end of a scene. The drawings are then shown in very
	  rapid succession (typically 24 frames, or unique drawings, per second). This gives the illusion that the numerous still images form a complete, fluid animation.</p>

	<h2>Modern 2D Anmation</h2>
    <p>2D animation has, for some time now, taken a backseat to 3D computer graphics. The reason 2D in the film industry has been in decline is that people have just
		gotten used to such high quality complex rendering from the films they watch, it’s hard to go back. It’s a hard task convincing people to spend money to go see
		a movie that is not the last word in CGI technology.It’s a hard task convincing people to spend money to go see a movie that is not the last word in CGI technology.
Technology never goes back, and while you can make a point that 3D isn’t better than 2D, it’s still capable of showing more detailed, complex or realistic visuals than
		2D can. And that’s what people want. They vote with their wallets. 3D animated films make a TON of money, almost regardless of quality, while great non-3D films
		like <em>Kubo and the Two Strings</em>or<em>Titan AE</em> or <em>Treasure Planet</em> flop in the box office.</p>
	  <p>But we’re actually going to see more 2D animation then ever. Because animation got much cheaper to produce than it used to, and the power is now distributed
		  between all of us, rather than held in the hands of a few gatekeepers, more and more artists and small studios can make their own 2D movies, shorts and series.</p></div>

    <h2>History of Traditional Animation</h2>
    <p> Although Walt Disney is often credited with making 2D animation with Mickey Mouse, he was not the first person to create a 2D animation. The first 2D animation ever
      made was called <em>Fantasmagorie</em>, a short cartoon made by Emile Cohl. Created entirely in black and white, the cartoon begins with Emile drawing a simple 
		stick man in live action.The cartoon is about 75 seconds long and it took about 700 different drawings to create. This historic animation was released in 1908,
		which predates <em>Steamboat Willie </em>(the first cartoon to feature Mickey Mouse) by about 20 years.</p>
